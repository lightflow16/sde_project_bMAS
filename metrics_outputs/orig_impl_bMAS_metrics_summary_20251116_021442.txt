Ground Truth: 3
Final Answer: Planner: Problem: Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?
Planning: Decompose the problem into smaller steps: 1. Calculate the total number of cups made. 2. Calculate the hourly revenue. 3. Calculate the hourly cost. 4. Calculate the hourly profit.
Correct: True
