Problem: Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store.  He bought 2 bag of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00.  How much did the apple pie cost?...
Ground Truth: 2
Final Answer: It seems that we have reached a conclusion, but I would like to note that we don't actually know if Gus spent his remaining $7 on an apple pie. We only know that he had $7 left after buying other items. To accurately determine the cost of the apple pie, we should ask more information about the purchase or the situation.
