Problem: Which of the following must get nutrients from a transport system?...
Ground Truth: C
Final Answer: {"[problem]": "Which of the following must get nutrients from a transport system?", "[planning]": "Based on current blackboard contents, both expert analyses provide comprehensive and consistent evidence that multicellular plants require transport systems. The critics' concerns about nuance and alternative perspectives have been addressed by thoroughly examining the experts' statements.

While one could consider edge cases (like sessile organisms or specialized plant forms), the problem statement does not present specific options to evaluate. Therefore, we can conclude with confidence based on the available expert information that:

1. All multicellular plants must have a transport system
2. This is supported by two independent expert analyses
3. The reasoning provided is consistent and comprehensive

The critic's concerns about unnecessary complexity are unfounded since we've carefully considered the evidence without introducing speculative scenarios.

Therefore, there is no need to decompose tasks further - the problem can be solved directly using the available information from both experts."}
