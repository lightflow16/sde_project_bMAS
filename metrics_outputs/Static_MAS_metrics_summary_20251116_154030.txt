Problem: A landscaper agreed to maintain the yard of a homeowner for six months for a fee of $300 per month, payable at the end of the six-month period. This amount was the fair market value of the work to be ...
Ground Truth: C
Final Answer: {
    "answer": "A",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "explanation": "The landscaper and the homeowner entered into a contract where the landscaper agreed to maintain the yard for six months at $300 per month. The landscaper performed the work for four months, but then breached the contract by stopping the work to take another job. The homeowner refused to pay the landscaper anything.

In this scenario, the landscaper is seeking payment for the four months of work already completed. However, the homeowner can be considered as being unjustly enriched if they were not required to pay for the services rendered, and the landscaping cost was $300 per month.

The most likely result would be that the homeowner will recover $600, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates. This is because the contract was breached by the landscaper, but the homeowner can still recover the damages resulting from the breach.",
