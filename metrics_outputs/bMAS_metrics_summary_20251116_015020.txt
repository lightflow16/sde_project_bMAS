Problem: From year to year, farmers rotate different crops in the fields to improve soil nutrients. Why is crop rotation also an effective pest management method?...
Ground Truth: C
Final Answer: • Crop rotation can create *ecological traps* for pests by shifting host availability and resource quality, forcing pests to expend energy searching for suitable hosts.
• Aligning rotation schedules with pest phenology (e.g., planting non‑host crops during peak pest emergence) maximizes suppression by interrupting key life‑stage windows.
• Incorporating cover crops within rotations supplies continuous nectar, pollen, and prey resources that sustain predators and parasitoids, creating a ready‑made biological control force.
• Rotational diversity reduces the accumulation of pest‑attracting allelochemicals and host‑specific cues, diminishing pest recruitment and host fidelity.
• Combining rotation with other cultural practices—such as intercropping, mulching, and adjusted planting dates—amplifies pest suppression and enhances overall ecosystem resilience.
